# GameBoy

<h5>Simple GameBoy emulator using Win32,SDL,OpenGL

So I found this awsome GameBoy CPU instruction manual [here](http://marc.rawer.de/Gameboy/Docs/GBCPUman.pdf) and decided it'll be a fun weekend project to work on.

Used SDL cause planning to make this project crossplatform specially for PS4 and Switch.

There are few bugs and issues I'll work on (probably).

Games working perfect : TETRIS, Mario 2, Zelda - Links Awakening, Bragon Ball Z

Game Booting but getting stuck : Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat

Unfortunately None of the Pokemon game worked which was the reason I wanted to make this project so.... 

Some Screen Shots of Games it can play :
